# **Introduction of CSS**
* ## css associates rules
  * 1-CSS syntax follows a simple rule-set that consists of two principles: CSS selectors and declaration blocks.

  * 2-CSS is for assigning certain values to properties. In other words, CSS tells the browser which fonts, colors, decorations, or other features HTML elements use.

  With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

* ## Using Inernal CSS
  An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style. The internal style is defined inside the style tag element, inside the head section.

* ## Types of CSS selectors
  There are many different types of CSS selector that allow you to target rules to specific elements in an HTML document.

* ## How Css Rules Cascade
  The CSS Cascade is the algorithm by which the browser decides which CSS styles to apply to an element

* ## CSS Inheritance
  In CSS, some styles are inherited down the HTML document tree while others are not. While this can be confusing, the principle behind it is actually designed to allow to write fewer CSS rules.
