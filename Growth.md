* ### The Drs. Sarah on Impostor Syndrome 
  - Imposter syndrome is the experience of feeling like a phony you feel as though at any moment you are going to be found out as a fraud like you don't belong where you are, and you only got there through dumb luck. It can affect anyone no matter their social status, work background, skill level, or degree of expertise.
  - Some of the common signs of imposter syndrome include: Self-doubt, An inability to realistically assess your competence and skills, Attributing your success to external factors, Berating your performance, Fear that you won't live up to expectations, Overachieving , Sabotaging your own success and Setting very challenging goals and feeling disappointed when you fall short
  - for some people, impostor syndrome can fuel feelings of motivation to achieve, this usually comes at a cost in the form of constant anxiety. You might over-prepare or work much harder than necessary to "make sure" that nobody finds out you are a fraud
  - Impostor syndrome and social anxiety may overlap. A person with social anxiety disorder (SAD) may feel as though they don't belong in social or performance situations.
  - While the symptoms of social anxiety can fuel feelings of imposter syndrome, this does not mean that everyone with imposter syndrome has social anxiety or vice versa. People without social anxiety can also feel a lack of confidence and competence. Imposter syndrome often causes normally non-anxious people to experience a sense of anxiety when they are in situations where they feel inadequate.
  - A few different types of imposter syndrome that have been identified are:

    - The perfectionist: Perfectionists are never satisfied and always feel that their work could be better. Rather than focus on their strengths, they tend to fixate on any flaws or mistakes. This often leads to a great deal of self-pressure and high amounts of anxiety.


    - The superhero: Because these individuals feel inadequate, they feel compelled to push themselves to work as hard as possible.

 
    - The expert: These individuals are always trying to learn more and are never satisfied with their level of understanding. Even though they are often highly skilled, they underrate their own expertise.

    - The natural genius: These individuals set excessively lofty goals for themselves, and then feel crushed when they don't succeed on their first try.

    - The soloist: These people tend to be very individualistic and prefer to work alone. Self-worth often stems from their productivity, so they often reject offers of assistance. They tend to see asking for help as a sign of weakness or incompetence. 

  - To get past impostor syndrome, you need to start asking yourself some hard questions. They might include things such as the following:
    - "What core beliefs do I hold about myself?"
    - "Do I believe I am worthy of love as I am?"
    - "Must I be perfect for others to approve of me?"

  - Perfectionism plays a significant role in impostor syndrome. You might think that there is some perfect "script" for conversations and that you cannot say the wrong thing. You probably have trouble asking for help from others and may procrastinate due to your own high standards.
  - To move past these feelings, you need to become comfortable confronting some of those deeply ingrained beliefs you hold about yourself. This can be hard because you might not even realize that you hold them, but here are some techniques you can use: Share your feelings, Focus on others, Assess your abilities, Take baby steps, Question your thoughts, Stop comparing, Use social media moderately and Stop fighting your feelings.
