    * **Some page designs expand and shrink to fit the size of the user's screen. In this case  
    *min-width , max-width ,min-height and max-height* are used**

# **Arrays**
  An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.

  - Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).

# **switch statements**
* ***switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match)***
