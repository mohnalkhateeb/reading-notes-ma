* # HTML5 Layout
  * ### Traditional HTML Layouts
    - web page authors used <div> elements to group together related elements
    - Authors used class or id attributes to indicate the role of the <div> element in the structure of the page.

  * ### New Html5 Layout Elements
    - HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors using them already.
    - figre below show html5 layout elements
    ![HTML5 Layout](https://stuyhsdesign.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/yoko-html5.png)
    - The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
    - The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements).
    - Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.
    - To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.
* # Extra MarkuP
  - DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
  - You can add comments to your code between the <!-- and --> markers.
  - The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.
  - The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
  - <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
  - The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.
  - Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.
