# HOW HTML, CSS, & JAVASCRIPT FIT TOGETHER
* ## Progressive Enhancement
  1- HTML only
  2- HTML + CSS
  3- HTML + CSS + JavaScript
## Creating a Basic JavaScript 
 - #### Code below is a basic JavaScript 
   ![JSCODE](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Byounghyun-Yoo/publication/258509003/figure/fig13/AS:297643071819798@1447975046971/Simple-JavaScript-code-handling-the-TrackStart-event.png)


  - #### Linking to a javascript file from an HTML page in this html tag
    *<script src="js/ add-content.js"></ script>*
  - #### The best palce to put scripts in their own files is the end of the body 
  - A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a **statement**. 
  - *Statements should end with a semicolon*.
  - writting comments to explain what your code does.They help make your code easier to read and understand. This can help you and others who read your code.
    * Tow ways to write comment 
      1- // for single line
      2- */*  */* for multi line
  - A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in **variables**.
  - A **variable** is a good name for this concept because the data stored in a variable can change (or vary) each time a script runs
  - The variable decleration is as this
    ***var x;***
  - The variable Assigning is as  this  ***x=3;***
  -JavaScript distinguishes between numbers,strings, and true or false values known as Booleans.
      * 3 is a number
      * 'Ahmed' is a strings
      * Boolean is a true or false



  * A variable name in JavaScript 
      1- must be started with a letter.
      2- can contain letters,numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_). Note that you must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name.
      3- should not be ***keyWord*** such as ***if***
      4-is the case sensetive: so score and Score would be different variable names, but it is bad practice to create two variables that have the same name using different cases.
