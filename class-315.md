* ### What is a Component?
    **A component** is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface

* ### What is Props?
    **Props** is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.

* ### What is the big difference between props and state?
    props (short for “properties”) and state are both plain JavaScript objects. While both hold information that influences the output of render, they are different in one important way: props get passed to the component (similar to function parameters) whereas state is managed within the component (similar to variables declared within a function).

* ###  What is node.js?
    **Node.js** is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine that is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.
* ### What is npm?
     npm is  the world’s largest software registry that is a package manager that the node comes bundled with it 
* ### What does a GET do?
    The web page just specifies the URLs to the images and the browser goes and does more GETs using the HTTP protocol on them until all the resources are obtained and the web page is displayed. But the important thing here is that very different kinds of nouns can be treated the same. Whether the noun is an image, text, video, an mp3, a slideshow, whatever. 

* ### What does a POST do?
     POST is used by HTTP to add something from one system to another system

* ### What does PUT do?
    PUT is used by HTTP to help a system wants to replace something in another system

* ### What is a module?
    **Module** in Node.js is a simple or complex functionality organized in single or multiple JavaScript files which can be reused throughout the Node.js application.Each module in Node.js has its own context, so it cannot interfere with other modules or pollute global scope.

* ### What is OAuth?
    OAuth is an open-standard authorization protocol or framework that describes how unrelated servers and services can safely allow authenticated access to their assets without actually sharing the initial, related, single logon credential. In authentication parlance, this is known as secure, third-party, user-agent, delegated authorization.

* ### What is a NoSQL database?
    A NoSQL (originally referring to "non-SQL" or "non-relational") database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. Such databases have existed since the late 1960s, but the name "NoSQL" was only coined in the early 21st century,triggered by the needs of Web 2.0 companies.NoSQL databases are increasingly used in big data and real-time web applications

* ### How does it work?
    NoSQL databases store data in documents rather than relational tables. Accordingly, we classify them as "not only SQL" and subdivide them by a variety of flexible data models. Types of NoSQL databases include pure document databases, key-value stores, wide-column databases, and graph databases. NoSQL databases are built from the ground up to store and process vast amounts of data at scale and support a growing number of modern businesses.
* ### What does app.use(express.json()) do?
    The express.json() function is a built-in middleware function in Express. It parses incoming requests with JSON payloads and is based on body-parser
